BOOK Ι.

Arnen the subversion of liberty in the republic‚
Cicero retired to his Pompeinn ville and devoted
himself to philosophical pursuits. He there wrote
the following trectise on moral dutiee for the hen-
efit of his son, a student at Athene. 'I'hie subject,
though acommon one among the different secte,
belongs peculiarly to those who placed the chief
good in what is fit, as the Academico, Peripatetico
ond Stoice. “

Cicero inclined to the opinions of the Stoice,
modified however according to his own judgment.

Secrron l. Cicero exhorts his son notto forget

his Latin, altho'ugh he was in a Greek University,
but to leorn to write both these lenguages os be-

comes a philosopher ond an orator.
